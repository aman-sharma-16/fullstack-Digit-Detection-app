# Full Digits Detection App

A full-stack web application that classifies digits from user input. Users can provide an image and the app predicts the corresponding digit using a machine learning model.

### ‚ö° Testing with 8√ó8 Grayscale Matrices

Currently, the app accepts **image input only**. During testing, we also tried providing **8√ó8 grayscale matrices** as input.

- The ML model itself achieves **>89% accuracy** on the dataset.
- Prediction errors occur in the app due to **mismatch between the frontend grayscale mapping and the format expected by the model**.
- Proper scaling and preprocessing of matrix inputs will enable accurate predictions, extending the app beyond image uploads.

> Note: The model is highly accurate, but input preprocessing differences are the main source of errors when using 8√ó8 matrices.You can manually use the model with 8x8 grayscale image giving in the repo.

## üöÄ Features
